# exp_db_evidence_pipeline

DB-evidence pipeline experiment — tests two coordinated structural rules
in opensre's bench prompt:

1. **Dependency-traversal rule (Layer 1):** when the failing service
   shows connection-shaped errors, also query the stateful dependency
   pod's logs (MySQL / Redis / queue) before concluding.
2. **Alert-anchored upstream-attribution rule (Layer 2 / V2 prompt):**
   when the alert names a service AND describes a performance / latency
   / network / resource issue, trust the alert's named service. The
   downstream services with noisy logs are usually victims, not causes.

Both rules live in
`tests/benchmarks/cloudopsbench/bench_agent.py:_TRIMMED_BENCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `preregistration.yml` | Locked predictions + decision matrix + rollback rules. Committed before any full-N run. |
| `smoke_db_pod_logs.yml` | n=40 three-arm smoke; first observation of the dual-layer pipeline. |
| `smoke_perf_only.yml` | n=25 Performance-only diagnostic; isolates the Performance category to test for regression. |
| `full_n.yml` | n=452 full-N promotable run. Uses `preregistration.yml`. |

## Runs (config ↔ result ledger)

Every row links the **config that produced it**, the **S3 run dir** with
raw artifacts, and the **report** with the analysis. Keep this updated
when a new run lands.
