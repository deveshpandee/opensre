    ``pydantic.ValidationError`` renders the raw invalid field value (often a

    ``input_value=...``. Sentry's ``before_send`` hook scrubs that pattern from
    captured events, but this function also logs locally with ``exc_info``,
    which bypasses the Sentry scrubber entirely. Swap in a message-only
    ``ValueError`` so no call site has to do this itself.

    The wrapper reuses the original exception's ``__traceback__`` (but not
    ``__cause__`` — chaining would print the raw ``ValidationError`` text as
    part of the chain in local logs, defeating the swap above) so logs and
